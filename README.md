I'm a computing science / economics student at Simon Fraser University in BC, Canada 🍁. My tools of choice include JavaScript/Node, C++, C#, D and Swift. I am particularly interested in computer systems, multi-platform app development, computer vision, and fintech. I speak 🇨🇦 English, 🇷🇸 Serbo-Croatian, and a bit of 🇯🇵 Japanese. I am currently learning 🇫🇷 French.
